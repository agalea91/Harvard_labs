# Harvard_labs_cs109
I'm independently working through the labs for Harvard's CS109 data-science course using Python 3 (they were originally designed for Python 2).

Topics include: 
-Data munging, cleaning, and sampling  
-Data management to be able to access big data quickly and reliably  
-Exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition  
-Prediction based on statistical methods such as regression and classification  

If possible I have been using different data than what has been provided for the lab.  This way I end up with a unique result and I am forced to think about what is going on more than if I were simply following along.
