# Harvard CS109 labs
I'm independently working through the labs for Harvard's data-science course using Python 3 (they were originally designed for Python 2).

Topics include: 
- Data munging, cleaning, and sampling  
- Data management to be able to access big data quickly and reliably  
- Exploratory data analysis to generate hypotheses and intuition  
- Prediction based on statistical methods such as regression and classification  

If possible I have been using different data than what has been provided for the lab.  This way I end up with unique results and I'm forced to solve problems along the way.
